## net-cat

### Authors:

Arshat Aitkozha (@araitkozha), Ilyas Telman (@itelman).

### Objectives

This project consists on recreating the **NetCat in a Server-Client Architecture** that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.

- NetCat, `nc` system command, is a command-line utility that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP. It is used for anything involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets, it is able to open TCP connections, send UDP packages, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports and many more.

- To see more information about NetCat inspect the manual `man nc`.

This project works in a similar way that the original NetCat works, in other words, it is a group chat. The project has the following features:

- TCP connection between server and multiple clients (relation of 1 to many).
- A name requirement to the client.
- Control connections quantity.
- Clients are able to send messages to the chat.
- EMPTY messages from a client are not broadcasted.
- Messages sent, are identified by the time that was sent and the user name of who sent the message, example : `[2020-01-20 15:48:41][client.name]:[client.message]`
- If a Client joins the chat, all the previous messages sent to the chat are uploaded to the new Client.
- If a Client connects to the server, the rest of the Clients are informed by the server that the Client joined the group.
- If a Client exits the chat, the rest of the Clients are informed by the server that the Client left.
- All Clients receive the messages sent by other Clients.
- If a Client leaves the chat, the rest of the Clients will not disconnect.
- If there is no port specified, then the default port is set as 8989. Otherwise, program responds with usage message: `[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port`

### Additional Information

- The project is written in **Go**
- TCP server is started to listen and accept connections
- The project has Go-routines
- The project has channels or Mutexes
- Maximum 10 connections are supported
- The code respects the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md)
- Errors from server side and client side are handled

### Packages Used:

- io
- log
- os
- fmt
- net
- sync
- time
- bufio
- errors
- strings
- reflect

### Usage: how to run

```console
$ go run cmd/main.go
Listening on the port :8989
$ go run cmd/main.go 2525
Listening on the port :2525
$ go run cmd/main.go 2525 localhost
[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port
$
```

- The client is answered with a linux logo and prompted for their name, when connection is received

```console
$ nc $IP $port

- Accept connection with non-empty name

The client :

```console
$ nc $IP $port
```

Server:

```console
$ go run cmd/main.go 2525
Listening on the port :2525
```

Client1 (Yenlik):

```console
$ nc localhost 2525
